EnKF for Lorenz 96 model

Why study the synchronization of chaotic systems when the coupling between them contains both time averages 
and stochastic noise?  The model dynamics are given by the Lorenz equations show that coupling two 
copies of the Lorenz equations using a feedback control which consists of time averages
leads to exact synchronization provided the time-averaging window is  known  and  sufficiently  small.   
In  the  presence  of  noise  the  convergence  is  within  a  factor  of  the  variance  of  the  noise.   
Further numerical computations show that synchronization is more accurate and occur sunder much less 
stringent conditions than theory requires.
